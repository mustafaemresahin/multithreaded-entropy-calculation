# Multithreaded Incremental Entropy Calculator (PA1)

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a multithreaded incremental entropy algorithm, as proposed in the paper "Entropy-based scheduling performance in real-time multiprocessor systems" by Dr. Rincon. This project was developed as part of my Operating Systems course at the University of Houston.

## Objective
The aim of this assignment is to create a multithreaded version of the incremental entropy algorithm. The program reads a series of strings representing task scheduling information of CPUs in a multiprocessor system and calculates the entropy at each scheduling instant using POSIX threads.
