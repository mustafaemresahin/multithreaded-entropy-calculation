# Multithreaded Incremental Entropy Calculator (PA1)

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a multithreaded incremental entropy algorithm, as proposed in the paper "Entropy-based scheduling performance in real-time multiprocessor systems" by Dr. Rincon. This project was developed as part of my Operating Systems course at the University of Houston.
